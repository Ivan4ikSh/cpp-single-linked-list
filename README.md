# Single-Linked List Implementation

## Description
This project provides an implementation of a Single-Linked List in C++. It includes a comprehensive suite of tests to validate the functionality and exception safety of the list operations. The key features of this implementation include element insertion, deletion, and traversal capabilities, along with exception safety guarantees.

## Features
- **PushFront**: Insert an element at the front of the list.
- **PopFront**: Remove the front element of the list.
- **InsertAfter**: Insert an element after a given position.
- **EraseAfter**: Remove an element after a given position.
- **Iterator Support**: Traverse the list using iterators.

## Installation and Usage
To compile and run the tests for the Single-Linked List implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
